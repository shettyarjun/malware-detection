# Malware Detection using Images

This project aims to detect malware using image representations of the binaries. It utilizes a Kaggle dataset containing images of both benign and malware binaries to train a machine learning model for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains images of benign and malware binaries. You can download the dataset from the zip file in the repo.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Required Python packages listed
- u can use kaggle or google collab

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or copy the code in google collab
   
3. Install the required Python packages:
    
4. Download the dataset from repo,unzip and place it in the `archive` directory of your drive.

5. Preprocess the dataset if necessary. This may include resizing images, converting to grayscale, or extracting features.

6. train the model

7. predict the type using sample image of simialr file type
